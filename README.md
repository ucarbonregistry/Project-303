______
UCR Approved: Positive List Additionality
_______________
Prior History: CDM Rejected (2006)
Reason: The CDM Board agreed to reject the project activity considering that none of the investment, technological
and prevailing practice barriers were adequately demonstrated in the PDD and that the project
participant and the DOE (DNV) failed to substantiate these barriers in response to the request of the
review team, and therefore the project activity did not meet additionality requirements as stipulated in
paragraphs 43 to 52 of the CDM modalities and procedures.
